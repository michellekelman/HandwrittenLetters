# HandwrittenLetters
## CS 6375.002 Final Project
### Project Title: Recognizing Handwritten Letters using Neural Network Algorithms
### Team Members:
- Michelle Kelman
- Jihan Wang
### Dataset Type: 
- Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist
### Algorithm Approach:
- Own Implementation
- Neural Network models with different activation functions
### How To Use:
1. Clone our project
2. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link above
3. Copy the extracted data files into the project data folder
4. Process the data: `python data.py`
5. Run the different models:
   1. Our Neural Network implementation: `python relu.py`
   2. scikit Neural Network MLPClassifier(): `python s-relu.py`
   3. Keras Convolutional Neural Network: `python k-relu.py`
